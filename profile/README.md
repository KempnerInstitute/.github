Welcome to the Github page for the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University. We are a community of students, researchers and engineers committed to unlocking the mysteries of intelligence in both natural and artificial contexts.

### About Kempner Institute
The [Kempner Institute](https://www.harvard.edu/kempner-institute/about/) seeks to understand the basis of intelligence in natural and artificial systems by recruiting and training future generations of researchers to study intelligence from biological, cognitive, engineering, and computational perspectives. Its bold premise is that the fields of natural and artificial intelligence are intimately interconnected; the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) will require the same principles that our brains use for fast, flexible natural reasoning, and understanding how our brains compute and reason can be elucidated by theories developed for AI.

### Purpose of this GitHub Org

We are committed to open science and this page offers a forum for sharing open-source software developed by Kempner Institute researchers, collaborating on open-source projects on intelligence in natural and artificial contexts, and building a community of AI developers.
